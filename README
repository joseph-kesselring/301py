This is a simple tool that has been created in python to automate the process of migrating multiple web pages to a central website(domain). 

Reason:
When migrating websites from one domain to another, or even updating one website, there is a need to update the destinations of web pages that are defunct to an updated location. When they all need to be updated to one domain this tool automates that process.

There are more efficient means in some use cases, for my uses this was the most effective and efficient.
